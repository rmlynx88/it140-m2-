## Purpose

During the Construct phase, you turn the provided design into a working Python program.

You will complete the [`name_age.py`](./name_age.py) starter file in small steps. Use your [Software Development Worksheet (SDW)](../name_age_sdw.md) and the provided [pseudocode](../design/name_age.pseudo) to guide your work.

This starter file contains more Python structure than programs you have seen so far. Some of that structure uses concepts you have not learned yet. **You are not expected to understand or write all of it yet.**

### Edit Only TODO Lines

**Only change lines marked with `TODO:`.**

This includes:

* `TODO:` lines inside the module docstring
* `# TODO:` comment lines inside `main()`
* `# TODO:` lines in the References section

Do not change any other lines of code in the starter file, including the imports, constants, main function definition, main guard, or other provided code. You may cause a Python syntax error if you change those lines and your program will not run.

When you replace a `# TODO:` line inside `main()`, keep your new code at the **same indentation level** as the TODO comment. Indentation is important in Python. The starter file uses four spaces for indentation inside `main()`.

## Deliverable

**This phase produces a deliverable.**

You will complete [`name_age.py`](./name_age.py) during this phase. After completing the Test phase, you will submit this file in **D2L Brightspace** for grading as part of the Module Two Assignment.

The Module Two Assignment also includes a separate **IDE Features Reflection** deliverable. You will complete that separately.

## What You Will Use

Use the following provided materials to complete this phase:

* [`name_age.py`](./name_age.py) — the Python starter file you will complete and later submit for grading.
* [Software Development Worksheet (SDW)](../name_age_sdw.md) — contains your Analyze and Design working notes.
* [Pseudocode](../design/name_age.pseudo) — provides a step-by-step, programming-language-independent description of the solution.
* [Software Design Document (SDD)](../design/name_age_sdd.md) — explains how the solution is designed.
* [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](../analysis/name_age_srs.md) — defines what the completed program must do.

Relevant zyBooks topics include:

* **1.3 Basic input and output**
* **1.13 Variables and assignments**
* **1.14 Identifiers**
* **1.16 Arithmetic expressions**
* **1.17 Python expressions**
* **1.19 Module basics**
* **1.20 Math module**
* **2.6 Type conversions**
* **2.7 String formatting**

## What You Will Do

### 1. Read the Starter File Before Editing

Open [`name_age.py`](./name_age.py) and read it from beginning to end before making changes.

The file is organized approximately as:

```text
Module docstring
Imports
Constants
Main function
Main guard
References
```

This organization helps make a Python source file easier to read. The large section-header comments in this starter file are **instructional scaffolding** to help you recognize those parts. Professional Python code normally relies more on conventional ordering, descriptive names, and blank lines than on large section-header comments. Note that by convention, two blank lines separate top-level structures such as the module docstring, imports, constants, and function definitions.

### 2. Complete the Module Docstring

The triple-quoted text at the beginning of `name_age.py` is a **module documentation string**, usually called a **module docstring**.

A module docstring explains the purpose and use of the Python module. Python's [**PEP 257 — Docstring Conventions**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) recommends that a multi-line docstring begin with a short summary, followed by a blank line and additional information.

The starter docstring follows that basic pattern but adds several instructional sections:

* **Input** — data the program needs, including its type and source
* **Process** — how the program transforms input into output
* **Output** — what the program produces and where it goes
* **Typical usage example** — an example of the program being used

The Input → Process → Output structure is an IT 140 learning convention. It is not a required PEP 257 docstring format.

#### Use Your SDW

You have already done most of the thinking needed for the docstring in your Software Development Worksheet (SDW). Use your SDW to complete the module docstring in `name_age.py`. These sections may be particularly useful:

* Use **SDW 2. Program Purpose** for the one-line summary.
* Use **SDW 3. IPO: Inputs** for the `Input:` section.
* Use **SDW 3. IPO: Processing** for the `Process:` section.
* Use **SDW 3. IPO: Outputs** for the `Output:` section.
* Use your understanding of the SRS and test examples to create a **new, original** usage example.

Do not copy the SRS sample or an acceptance test case for your usage example. Choose your own example values and determine the correct result.

#### Write the Docstring Yourself

Write the module docstring **in your own words**. Do not copy text from the SRS, SDD, another source, or another person, and do not use an AI tool to generate it.

AI-assisted programming can help produce code quickly, but software developers must still be able to understand and explain what their programs do, what data they use, how they process that data, and what results they produce. Writing this short docstring yourself demonstrates that you understand the program you are constructing.

Only replace the lines in the Python file marked `TODO:`. Keep the provided headings and triple quotation marks (`"""`) unchanged.

### 3. Recognize the Import

You previously learned in zyBooks 1.19 that a **module** contains Python code that can be imported and used by another program.

This starter file introduces:

```python
from datetime import date
```

[`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/datetime.html) is a module in the [**Python Standard Library**](https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/index.html). The module defines a class named `date`.

The statement:

```python
from datetime import date
```

imports the `date` class name directly so the program can use one of its methods as:

```python
date.today()
```

to obtain the current date, including the current year, from the computer's current local date.

You do not need to understand the `datetime` module in more detail for this assignment, and **you should not change the import line**.

### 4. Recognize the Constant

The starter file introduces the concept of a **constant**. In zyBooks 1.13, you learned about variables and assignments. A constant is like a variable in that it holds a value assigned to it. While variables usually change as the program runs, a constant is intended to remain unchanged during the program's execution. Another difference is that constants are normally written in **UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES** (a.k.a. "upper snake case") instead of **lowercase_with_underscores** (a.k.a. "lower snake case") used for variable names.

The starter file defines a constant named `CURRENT_YEAR` and assigns it the current year from the system using the `date.today()` method:

```python
CURRENT_YEAR = date.today().year
```

For this program:

* `CURRENT_YEAR` receives the current year from the system.
* Its value is set before `main()` runs.
* The program treats that value as unchanged while performing its work.

This is why your SDW treats the current year as an input the program **obtains internally**, even though the user does not type it.

**Do not change the `CURRENT_YEAR` line.**

### 5. Recognize the Documentation and Comments

The starter file demonstrates several ways Python code can be documented.

#### Docstrings

A **docstring** is a string used to document a module, function, class, or method. Docstrings are not technically comments.

You see two docstrings in this file:

* The multi-line **module docstring** at the beginning of the file
* The one-line `"""Run the program."""` docstring inside `main()`

#### Block Comments

A **block comment** appears on its own line and describes code that follows it.

For example:

```python
# Calculate user's approximate birth year.
```

The `TODO` comments inside `main()` are also block comments, but they use a specific keyword to indicate tasks that need to be completed. Your job is to replace those `TODO` comments with working Python code.

#### Inline Comments

An **inline comment** appears on the same line as Python code.

For example:

```python
CURRENT_YEAR = date.today().year  # Get current year from system as integer
```

Inline comments should be used when they add information that is useful to the reader rather than simply repeating what the code already says. This particular inline comment would not be necessary in a professional program because the code is already clear. Since you are seeing it for the first time, it is included here to help you understand what that line of code does.

#### Instructional Section Headers

The starter also contains comments such as:

```python
# === Imports ===
# === Constants ===
# === Main Function ===
```

These section headers are included to help you recognize the major parts of your first structured Python module. They are **instructional scaffolding** comment lines and are not normally necessary in a small professional Python program.

Professional Python source files still use a predictable organization and blank lines to separate major structures. [PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/), for example, places imports near the beginning of a file and uses two blank lines around top-level function definitions.

### 6. Recognize the Main Function

All the code you write for this activity goes inside:

```python
def main() -> None:
    """Run the name-age program."""
```

The first line defines a function named `main()`. The second line is a docstring that describes what the function does. The `-> None` indicates that this function does not return a value. Do not change the `main()` definition or its docstring.

You will learn much more about functions in **zyBooks Chapter 5**. For now, you only need to know that `main()` contains the main sequence of code for this program.

Python uses indentation to identify code that belongs inside a function. The starter TODO comments inside `main()` are indented the standard four spaces:

```python
def main() -> None:
    """Run the program."""

    # TODO: Replace with code here.
```

When you replace one of those TODO comments with Python code, **keep the four-space indentation**.

### 7. Recognize the Main Guard

Near the bottom of the file you will see:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This is commonly called the **main guard**.

When this file is run directly, Python assigns the special string value `"__main__"` to `__name__`. The main guard then calls `main()` to start the program.

This structure also allows a Python file to be imported by another Python file without automatically running `main()`. That becomes useful as programs grow and when programs are tested.

You do not need to fully understand the main guard yet. You will learn more about functions later in the course and use this program structure again in later activities.

Notice that `main()` is indented beneath the `if` statement because it belongs to that block. You will learn about indentation and `if` statements in Module Three.

**Do not change either line of the main guard.**

### 8. Write the Program One TODO at a Time

Now complete the `# TODO:` lines inside `main()`.

Use the [pseudocode](../design/name_age.pseudo) as your primary coding guide. Note that pseudocode is not Python code. You will need to translate the pseudocode into correct Python syntax for your program to work.

#### Get the User's Name

Replace:

```python
# TODO: Replace with code to get user's name as a string. See zyBooks 1.3.
```

Use concepts from **zyBooks 1.3, Basic input section**.

#### Get the User's Age

Replace:

```python
# TODO: Replace with code to get user's age as an integer. See zyBooks 2.6.
```

Remember that `input()` provides text (i.e., a string). The program needs the age as an integer because it will use the age in arithmetic.

Review **zyBooks 2.6 Type conversions** if needed.

#### Calculate the Birth Year

Replace:

```python
# TODO: Replace with code to process data. See zyBooks 1.16 & 1.17.
```

Use your SRS, SDD, pseudocode, and SDW to determine the required arithmetic expression.

#### Display the Result

Replace:

```python
# TODO: Replace with code to output formatted results. zyBooks 1.3 & 2.7.
```

Review **zyBooks 1.3 Basic input and output** and **2.7 String formatting** if needed. We strongly recommend using an f-string for this output as introduced in zyBooks 2.7.

### 9. Run After Each Small Change

This activity depends on correct Python syntax and indentation.

Work incrementally:

1. Replace one code TODO.
2. Run the program.
3. Correct any syntax or other errors.
4. Continue to the next TODO only after the program runs again.

This makes it much easier to identify which recent change caused a problem.

Pay particular attention to:

* Matching quotation marks
* Matching parentheses
* Four-space indentation inside `main()`
* Variable-name spelling
* Correct use of `=`
* Correct placement of function calls such as `input()`, `int()`, and `print()`

> [!NOTE]
> **A spell-check underline does not necessarily mean there is an error.**
>
> The course IDE includes a spell checker that marks words it does not recognize with a blue squiggly underline. Names, technical terms, and other correctly spelled words may not be in the spell checker's dictionary.
>
> When you see a blue squiggly underline:
>
> 1. Check whether the word is spelled correctly.
> 2. If it is misspelled, correct it.
> 3. If it is spelled correctly, you can ignore the underline or add the word to the spell checker's dictionary by hovering your pointer over the word and selecting **Quick Fix**.
>
> A spell-check suggestion does **not** mean that your Python program contains an error.

### 10. Complete the References Section

The final section of the starter file is:

```python
# === References ===
# TODO: Replace with an APA-style reference for a source you used, or delete.
# TODO: Replace with another APA-style reference, or delete this TODO line.
```

The References section is an **SNHU course convention**, not a requirement of Python or PEP 8.

Software developers regularly build on documentation, libraries, examples, tools, and the work of other people. Professional practice requires respecting applicable attribution, licensing, organizational, and disclosure requirements. IT 140 uses the References section to build the habit of keeping the sources that influenced your work visible with the code.

Add APA-style references for outside sources you used beyond the provided course materials, including applicable:

* Documentation or websites
* Code examples
* IDE inline code suggestions
* AI chats or coding agents
* Other people or external resources that contributed to your solution

Do not add references merely because a source exists. Reference sources that you actually used.

If you did not use additional sources, delete the unused `# TODO:` reference lines.

The **module docstring remains your own original writing**, even if AI assistance is allowed for other parts of your work.

> **IDE Features Reflection reminder:** As you construct the program, notice how VS Code features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, indentation guides, and error indicators affect your work. Your observations may help when you complete the separate [IDE Features Reflection](../../Part-B/ide_features.md).
